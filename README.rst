A Rest-API using flask.

Right now this is merely a proof of concept to illustrate our current vision on
how to provide a proper REST-API as an universal interface for arbitrary clients
to build upon.

Getting started
----------------
:: 

  mkvirtualenv hamster-flask-api
  git clone git@github.com:projecthamster/hamster-flask-api.git
  cd hamster-flask-api
  pip install -e .
  hamster-flask-api

This should get you a development server running on ``localhost:5000`` running in
debug mode. This is of cause utterly useless for production but allows you to
testdrive the API in a rather convenient manner.
